# Second Project from Udemy: Tindog Website

<p>The main purpose of this project was to get used to reading documentation, using Bootstrap, and getting a website to be mobile friendly <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/">(responsiveness)</a>.</p>
<p>I did have some previous experience utilizing Bootstrap in older projects but did not grasp how to use it to it's full effectiveness. Which then brought up another question of: What was(is) the difference between Bootstrap and Media Query?</p>
<p><b>Boostrap</b> Is generally treated as a frame or skeleton of the website itself. Which then utilizes or uses <b>media query</b> to rearrange itself to best fit the size of the screen. A user going by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33804977/whats-the-difference-between-media-queries-and-bootstrap">ishraf</a> on stackoverflow defined media queries as, "the CSS mechanism for applying different styles depending on screen size, orientation, and other properties." </p>

<h3>New things Discovered (and re-discovered)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index">Z-index</a> aka "ZED". It refers to the positioning of an element with the larger z-index to cover the smaller one.</li>
  <br>
<li>Boostrap can do much in making a website responsive. Though it does have its limits when scaling down an image or sections that have mostly texts. In the tindog website I discovered that the texts don't scaled down to a more orderly fashion. To remedy this I had to create a separate media query in the css and modify it from there.Apprently, it is both bad practice and unrecommended to try and modify boostraps' set media queries. (This is something which is both obvious but wish I had known a couple months back). </li>
  <br>
  <li>Grids are amazing and heck of a lot easier to manipulate once I pracitced with them.</li>
  <br>
  <li>I need to work on my naming practices.</li>
  <br>
  <li>I need to learn how to work on padding and margins better so that my website looks even.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Code Refactoring</b></li>
 </ol>
